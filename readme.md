## Socket Tests

Just me goofing around playing with sockets. I'm interested in handling sockets from multiple sources, and server to server.

`npm install`

##### Startup
- `node node_modules/webserver/webserver.js`
- `node socket-server1.js`
- `node socket-server2.js`
- Visit client.html at `http://localhost:8003/client.html`
- Play in console.
